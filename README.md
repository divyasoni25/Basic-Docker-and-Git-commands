## Introduction
This repository serves as a beginner's guide to using Docker and Git commands effectively. It covers essential commands for Docker, such as creating Docker images, publishing them to Docker Hub, and integrating with GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.

## Commands Covered
1. **Create the Image**: Details on creating Docker images using a `Dockerfile`.
2. **Publish the Image to Docker Hub**: Steps to push Docker images to Docker Hub for distribution.
3. **GitHub Actions**: Example workflows (`docker-image.yml` and `pushImageToGithub.yml`) demonstrating how to automate Docker image builds and pushes using GitHub Actions.

## Technologies Used
- **Docker**: Containerization platform used to package and run applications.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD platform used for automating workflows.
- **Git**: Version control system for tracking changes in code.
